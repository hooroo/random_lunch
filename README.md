# Hooroo's Slack Lunch Bot

At Hooroo, we value the team culture we have built. We believe team lunches go a
long way in nurturing the culture we cherish. However, we have identified that we are
notoriously indecisive at times...

Enter Project Lunch Bot.

Project Lunch Bot aims to reduce the minimum time required to arrive at a decision.
By reducing the minimum time, we hypothesise that it will allow more quality time to be spent during team lunches.
The project also aims to inject element an element of surprise by being random.

### Key Features
- Takes in and processes a list of potential lunch places
- Picks a lunch place at random from the list
- Ensure the lunch place is open on the day
- Publicly announces suggestion in Hooroo's #lunch slack channel every weekday at 11:45am
- Be able to manually call it in case people prefer a different place

### Potential Future Features
- Allows Hooroo's team to add to list of lunch PLACES
- Pick a lunch place based on cuisine/type
